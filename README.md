# MVC-Based Ticket Theater Management System
This is an online theatre management and ticket purchasing web application that can be used by two types of users: theatre owners and customers (who are movie-goers). A customer can search for a movie and reserves a number of seats for a specific showing of that movie, at a specific theatre. An owner can manage movie listings and processes reservation information.
